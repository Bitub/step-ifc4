# bitub.step.ifc4
IFC release 4 - Xcore model representation

## General

Class model representation of Industry Foundation Classes (IFC ISO 16739) release 4. The Xcore model is generated by an M2M approach 
mapping the EXPRESS specification (ISO 10303-11) to Xcore.

## Build

### P2 update site for Eclipse 

Building manually for Eclipse Mars (default). This command will produce a local (default) update site.

```
	cd de.bitub.step.ifc4.build-resources
	mvn clean install
```

or from project root 

```
	mvn clean install -P platform-mars -f de.bitub.step.ifc4.build-resources/pom.xml
```

The repository will be mirrored to a local folder below user's profile in "./p2/repository/<targetplatform>" whereas the
target platform is defined by the profile. By default it is set to "luna". Future release will have multiple platforms.

If you like to publish the artifacts to another folder (CI builds etc.) set up the build variable manually:

```
	mvn -Dbitub.updatesiteLocal=<local writeable folder> clean install
```

The mirror task is associated with the <install> lifecycle step.
